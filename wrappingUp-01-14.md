# Wrapping Up
## Section 1, Lecture 14

In this quick start section you created your first Angular Application!

You should now have at least a top level view of what an Angular 2 application is, how it functions and how to go about architecting it.

# We covered:

## Environment
How to use plnkr.co to write Angular 2 apps in a browser</dd>

## Components
Which let us extend the HTML language to create new tags and forms the basis of an Angular 2 application.

## Bootstrapping
How to actually make Angular load and take control of a HTML page.

## Binding
String interpolation with {‌{ }} and both input property binding as well as output event binding.

## NgFor
How to render multiple elements using the the built-in NgFor directive.

## Data Modelling
We touched on data modelling, by creating our own Joke class which encapsulated all our data and logic relate to a joke.

## Template Local Variables
Capturing user input from users by adding # variables to input controls.

## Architecture
We started to see how we go about building Angular apps by wiring together inputs and outputs in order to glue Components together.

We’ll be going into much more detail into each of these topics, and others, in future chapters.

However since Angular 2 is based on Typescript it makes sense to get a good understanding of those features before we dive into the rest of this course so that’s the topic of the next section.
